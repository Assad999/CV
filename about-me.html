  <h1><a href="lone-wolf.html">Lone Wolf</a></h1>
  <p>I see myself as Lone Wolf because true definition of it is "He is happy with his social circle and not interested to interact with outsiders. Also I like to visit different cities, places. I'm a very big fan of natural beauty and natural diet. I
    like natural food(unprocessed food) very much. I do not like very much junk food or frozen food.
    I'm 28 years old but still want improvements in myself. I want to be the satisfactory boss of someone. I want to be the true leader. "</p>
